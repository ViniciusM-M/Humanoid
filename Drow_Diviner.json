					"Drow mages are often powerful in the arcane arts. However, many drow spell-weavers specialize in other forms of magic. Diviners are male drow who do not fit the bill for traditional mages, or female drow who wish to avoid the cutthroat power politics of drow society, but still seek to make a name for themselves with other magic. In many ways, they act similarly to priestesses of Lolth, but not wielding the same levels of power; personal or political. With these abilities, other drow seek out diviners as healers or what could pass for sages in their society. That said, diviners tend to have a few highly destructive magic tricks up their sleeves, just in case things do not go their way."
